## üîß Usage Examples

### Basic Analysis
```bash
# Analyze a smart contract
python main.py 0x1234... --type contract

# Analyze a protocol
python main.py /path/to/protocol --deep

# Generate proof of concept
python main.py target --generate-poc
```

### Test the System
```bash
# Run system test
python test_system.py

# Analyze test contract
python main.py test/vulnerable_contract.sol --verbose
```

## üéì Technical Innovations
