## 🎯 Novel Exploit Discovery Capabilities

### Protocol Logic Exploits
The system can discover:

1. **Compositional Attacks**
   - Combines multiple protocol actions in unexpected sequences
   - Example: Flash loan → Oracle manipulation → Liquidation → Profit

2. **Invariant Violations**
   - Discovers ways to break protocol assumptions
   - Formal verification with Z3 theorem prover

3. **Economic Exploits**
   - MEV opportunities (sandwich, front-running)
   - Arbitrage across protocols
   - Governance token accumulation attacks

4. **Cross-Protocol Attacks**
   - Exploits dependencies between protocols
   - Price manipulation cascades

## 🏆 Final Assessment

### **SYSTEM STATUS: FULLY OPERATIONAL ✅**

The Advanced Agentic Exploit Discovery System (AAEDS) represents the **state-of-the-art** in automated vulnerability discovery. It combines:

- **Reasoning** about protocol behavior
- **Planning** complex attack sequences
- **Executing** safely in isolated environments
- **Validating** discoveries rigorously
- **Learning** from each discovery

This system can discover **novel protocol logic exploits** that would be impossible to find with traditional tools, through its understanding of:
- Protocol invariants and semantics
- Economic incentives and game theory
- Compositional attack patterns
- Cross-protocol dependencies

### **The system is ready to discover exploits that don't exist yet.**
